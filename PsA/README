Associates_and_Predictors.m: Matlab code to find correlates and predictors of a clinical variable, given neuroimaging and clinical data using general linear models (conn_glm). Outputs an Excel sheet called Results.xlsx.
CENTAUR_data.mat: Clinical data for PROMIS fatigue at three different timepoints (baseline, 3 months, 6 months). All baseline neuroimaging modalities from CENTAUR (PsA cohort of CORT), including structural grey matter volumes, thickness, and surface area, and functional connectivity matrices from resting-state data 
PROMIS_tables_figures.Rmd: R code to create tables and figures from the Associates_and_Predictors.m excel sheet output Results.xlsx 
Regions_order.csv: the brain region order as set by LIFT_data_v2.mat that the BRAF_tables_figures.Rmd would initially use 
Regions_order_compact.csv: the brain region order and naming that is better suited for the tables and figures produced by the  BRAF_tables_figures.Rmd 
Results.xlsx: the output from Associates_and_Predictors.m 
Tables.docx: the output from PROMIS_tables_figures.Rmd 
clean_duplicates.m: additional code that Predictors.m requires to handle duplicates in results.
