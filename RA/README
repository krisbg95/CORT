All baseline neuroimaging modalities from RA cohort of CORT, including structural grey matter volumes, thickness, and surface area, and functional connectivity matrices from resting-state data 
PROMIS_tables_figures.Rmd: R code to create tables and figures from the Associates_and_Predictors.m excel sheet output Results.xlsx 
Results.xlsx: the output from Associates_and_Predictors.m 
clean_duplicates.m: additional code that Predictors.m requires to handle duplicates in results.
